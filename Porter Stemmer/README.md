# Porter Stemmer Implementation
Based on the [An algorithm for suffix stripping, M.F.Porter, 1980](https://tartarus.org/martin/PorterStemmer/def.txt)

Run PorterStemmer.py for the implementation

Tested on dataset available on [Tartarus Porter Stemmer](https://tartarus.org/martin/PorterStemmer/)

Achieved complete accuracy on it.

Can be made faster by only finding 'cvc...' pattern once and referring to it in other functions.
